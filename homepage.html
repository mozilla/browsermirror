  <h1>Browser Mirror</h1>

  <div>Browser Mirror is a way of sharing your browser session with anyone
    else.  You share your session and you'll get a link which you can give
    to another person, and they'll see what you see, and can interact with
    the page at the same time as you.</div>

  <h2>How To Install It</h2>

  <div>Browser Mirror is implemented as a <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet">bookmarklet</a>.
    To install it simply <b>click and drag</b> the link/button below
    into your bookmark toolbar:</div>

  <div style="margin: 1em">
    <a style="padding: 0.3em; font-size: 120%; border: 2px outset #999; background-color: #ddd; border-radius: 5px; cursor: move;" href="javascript:(function () {window.runBookmarklet = {app: '_SERVER_', token: '_TOKEN_'};var n = 'jsmirror-script';var s = document.getElementById(n);if (s)  document.body.removeChild(s);s = document.createElement('script');s.src = '_JSMIRROR_';s.id = n;document.body.appendChild(s);})()">mirror</a>
  </div>

  <!-- Source:
(function () {
window.runBookmarklet = {app: '_SERVER_'};
var n = 'jsmirror-script';
var s = document.getElementById(n);
if (s)
  document.body.removeChild(s);
s = document.createElement('script');
s.src = '_JSMIRROR_';
s.id = n;
document.body.appendChild(s);
})()
  -->

  <div>Note: if you <em>click</em> the link you'll start sharing
  <em>this</em> page.  Which an easy way to test this out, so long as
  you don't get confused about what's happening.</div>

  <h2>How To Use It</h2>

  <div>Once you have installed the bookmarklet, go to a page you want
    to share.  It can be any page, something public on the web or
    something protected by a login (e.g., your Facebook homepage).
    Click on the "mirror" link and you'll start sharing that page.
    You'll see a box like this open up on the top right side of the
    page:
    </div>

  <div style="position: relative; float: right; padding-right: 0.5em;
    height: 10em; width: 7em;">
    <div style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 10px; background-color: #444; border: 2px solid #999; color: #fff; padding: 3px; border-radius: 3px;">
    <div style="position: relative; float: right; display: inline">
    <span style="border: 1px outset #999; cursor: pointer; width: 1em; text-align: center; color: #0f0;" title="Turn this on to show where the remote user is scrolled to">&#8597;</span>
    <span style="border: 1px outset #999; margin-left: 1px; cursor: pointer; width: 1em; text-align: center; color: #f00; font-weight: bold;" title="Press this button and click on the page to highlight a position on the page">&#10132;</span>
    <span style="border: 1px outset #999; margin-left: 1px; cursor: pointer; width: 1em; text-align: center">&#215;</span>
    </div>
    <div>
    <div><a title="Give this link to a friend to let them view your session" href="' + this.controller.channel.shareUrl + '" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #99f;">share</a></div>
    Chat:<div></div>
    <input type="text" style="width: 100%; font-size: 10px; background-color: #999; color: #000; border: 1px solid #000;" />
    </div>
  </div>
  </div>

  <div>Give the <u style="color: #006">share</u> link to your friend.
    When they open the page they'll see the same page as you, with a
    similar box in the corner.  As you might expect, you can chat with
    each other by typing into the little text box.  More than one
    person can view the same session, though this is largely untested
    and may result in surprising results. </div>

  <div>Once you are both sharing a page you can also see some of what
  you each are doing.  If you click on the

    <span style="border: 1px outset #999; background-color: #444; cursor: pointer; width: 1em; text-align: center; color: #f00; font-weight: bold;" title="Press this button and click on the page to highlight a position on the page">&#10132;</span>

    button you can then click anywhere in the page, and the location
    will be noted for everyone (and you can re-display the location by
    clicking on the link <u style="color: #006">position noted</u>
    that is added to chat). </div>

  <div>Because a page is potentially much bigger than the screen, you and
    the person you are sharing with may not be looking at the same part
    of the page.  To see where the other person is scrolled to click the
    button

    <span style="border: 1px outset #999; cursor: pointer; width: 1em; text-align: center; color: #0f0; background-color: #444" title="Turn this on to show where the remote user is scrolled to">&#8597;</span>

    When you click this you will be scrolled to the same position, and the
    location of the other screen will noted with red bars on the left and
    right of the page.  The bars will move as the other person scrolls, but
    you will not scroll with them (it only jumps once when you first click
    the button). </div>

  <div>Expect more ways to collaborate as this tool is developed.
  Ideas and feedback in this area is especially appreciated. </div>

  <h2>Interacting on a page</h2>

  <div>In addition to both people <em>seeing</em> the page, you can to
    some degree both interact with a page.  (Though it should be noted
    that this in particular is imperfect.) </div>

  <div>Everything actually happens in the browser that started the
  sharing, so if your friend does something that results in a message
  that is transmitted to the first computer, may make changes in
  response to what they did, and sends the results back to the friend.
  This may result in noticeable delays. </div>

  <div>If the remote person clicks on a link, for instance, the link
    will be followed.  This may be particularly confusing, because you
    must click on the <u style="color: #006">mirror</u> bookmarklet on
    each new page!  You may also both work on forms, searches,
    etc. </div>

  <h2>The Technology</h2>

  <div>The sharing is done at the <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model">DOM</a>
  level.  This is in contrast to a tool like <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Network_Computing">VNC</a>
  which shares pixels.  With Browser Mirror the DOM (HTML) is read and
  sent across the wire, then re-rendered on the other side.
  Javascript is <em>not</em> sent to the remote computer.  Also things
  like images and videos are not sent, so while the page need not be
  visible to the other computer (e.g., it requires a login) the images
  and other resources must be public.  (Maybe we'll fix this
  sometime?) </div>

  <div>Because peer-to-peer communication is hard, we simply send all
  data to a server which echos it to all the other computers (using <a
  href="http://socket.io/">Socket.IO</a>).  The server does not
  understand or look carefully at the messages, and were peer-to-peer
  communication more feasible then it would be preferrable.  Besides,
  most peer-to-peer systems have server fallback due to the difficulty
  of establishing connections through firewalls and IP translation.
  There is talk of a <a
  href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/dnd.html#peer-to-peer-connections">PeerConnection</a>
  browser API. </div>

  <div>Note that this does not use a cooperative collaboration
  technique, so it is unlike (for example) Etherpad or Google Docs
  (which use <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation">operational
  transformation</a>).  These systems are responsive and handle
  conflict well, but require considerably cooperation on the part of
  peers.  Because the goal is to share any web page, we cannot expect
  any cooperation on the part of web applications.  Also we cannot
  change the DOM or otherwise effect changes from a remote computer,
  as applications are not written with this in mind, and the state
  would become hopelessly confused.  The one exception to this is form
  fields, which are edited on the remote client and the resulting
  edits are sent back instead of more primitive operations (like
  clicks or key presses).  This is necessary in part because focus is
  not shared between computers (since we allow both browsers to be
  viewing different parts of the page), and in part because the
  responsiveness would simply be too poor.  Forms <em>usually</em> are
  allowed to operate fairly normally so this seems relatively
  reliable. </div>

  <h2>The Code</h2>

  <div>The code is hosted on <a
    href="https://github.com/ianb/browsermirror">github</a>.  There's
    no formal to-do list, but probably eventually it will be collected
    via github issues.  Right now there are too many known issues to
    even think of them as discrete "issues".</div>

  <div>This is a <a href="https://mozillalabs.com/">Mozilla Labs</a>
  experiment, started by <a href="mailto:ianb@mozilla.com">Ian
  Bicking</a></div>
