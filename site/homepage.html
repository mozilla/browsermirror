<h1>Browser Mirror</h1>

<p>Browser Mirror is a way of sharing your browser session with anyone
else.  You share your session and you'll get a link which you can give
to another person &mdash; they'll see what you see, and (with limits)
they can interact with the page at the same time as you.</p>

<h1>Getting Started</h2>

<p> Install the Firefox addon (no restart required!): </p>

<p style="padding: 0 2em 0 2em">
  <a class="btn btn-primary" href="/static/browsermirror.xpi">Install The Addon</a>
</p>

<p> After installation you should see a link in the bottom right of
your browser, like this: <img src="/static/share-button-screenshot.png"> </p>

<p> If you don't see that you might need to display the <strong>Add-on
bar</strong>, you can do this with <strong>View &gt; Toolbars &gt;
Add-on bar</strong>
(<a href="http://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-on-bar-quick-access-to-add-ons">read
more here</a>).</p>

<p> Once you've installed the addon, go to a page,
click <span style="text-decoration: underline; color:
#00f">share</span>, and a sidebar will open up &mdash; as long as the
sidebar is open you are sharing your session (though maybe no one else
is looking!)  To invite someone to actually look at what you are
doing, click <strong>share</strong> to get a link: </p>

<p> <img src="/static/share-link-screenshot.png"> </p>

<p> Click it: </p>

<p> <img src="/static/share-link-2-screenshot.png"> </p>

<p> Give that link to a friend, and they will see what's in your
tab. (Each time you click <span style="text-decoration: underline;
color: #00f">share</span> it will give you a new link.) </p>

<h2>How Does It Work?</h2>

<p> Browser Mirror is different than a typical screen-sharing
applications.  Instead of sharing the <em>image</em> that you see on
the screen, it shares the <em>page</em> that you are looking at.  It's
also not the same as sharing the URL &mdash; the other person
sees <em>what</em> you are looking at, they aren't just following
along with the same URL.  So you can look at a private page on an
intranet, or something that is bound to a session, like airplane
ticket purchases.  As you continue to surf, the other person will
follow along.  If you are using a dynamic application, the other
person will see the results as you interact with the application. </p>

<p> In most cases you can both interact with forms, though in some
fancier applications your friend may not be able to use the full
functionality of some parts of the page. </p>

<p> In technical terms, what Browser Mirror does is send the DOM to
the other person.  That is more or less the same as sending the HTML
of the page &mdash; but without any of the special information the
server uses to identify you, like cookies or Javascript state.  Only
the <em>visible</em> parts of the page are sent.  This is somewhat
like a screen sharing program, which sends pixels instead of DOM
elements.  Currently the elements are captured at regular intervals,
and diffs are sent to cut down on traffic. </p>

<h2>The Code</h2>

<p> The code is hosted on <a
href="https://github.com/mozilla/browsermirror">github</a>.</p>

<p> The code contains a Firefox Add-on, a simple Node.js server that
handles communication between the two browsers, and a web site for the
client to view. </p>
